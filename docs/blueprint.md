- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F3), with a brightness appropriate for the light color scheme, yet desaturated to 20% of the primary hue.
- Accent color: Deep blue (#5D5DA6), an analogous color to purple which complements the design; this is easily distinguishable in saturation and brightness.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif.
- Minimalist design to allow the content of users' notes to stand out without unnecessary UI clutter.
- Use simple and consistent icons for navigation and actions.
